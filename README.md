# appium-test-setup-suites
A test setup allowing you to run tests on the TestObject platform, exemplified through two basic tests on the [Calculator app](https://github.com/aluedeke/calculator) by Andreas LÃ¼deke. It improves on the [intermediate setup](https://github.com/testobject/appium-test-setup-intermediate) as it allows the user to organize his or her test runs in suites.
